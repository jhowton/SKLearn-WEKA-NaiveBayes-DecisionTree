# Comparison of Naive Bayes and Decision Trees built using SKLearn and WEKA on categorical and continuous datasets
Built predictive models of a categorical nursery dataset and a continuous leaf dataset using naive bayes and decision tree models in SKLearn and WEKA

* [Analysis.pdf](Analysis.pdf) is a report describing the techniques used and the results of the comparison.

* [categorical_sklearn_script.py](categorical_sklearn_script.py) produces models of categorical dataset [nursery.data](nursery.data).

* [continuous_sklearn_script.py](continuous_sklearn_script.py) produces models of categorical dataset [leaf.csv](leaf.csv).

* [nursery_tree.png](nursery_tree.png) and [leaf_tree.png](leaf_tree.png) are visualizations of the decision trees produced by
the python scripts.
